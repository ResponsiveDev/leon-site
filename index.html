        <h2>Welcome!</h2>

        <p>
          So you found us! Or maybe you saw we had a website in the
          <b>discord</b> or heard about it on the <b>podcast</b>? Either way,
          welcome!
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Responsive</b> is both the name of the <b>podcast</b> and the
          <b>discord</b> server that you can find most of the <b>community</b>
          in.
        </p>

        <p>We hope you enjoy your stay!</p>

        <h2>The Two</h2>

        <p>
          Now that's an mysterious title for a mediocre section, I like it!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <b>Responsive</b>, both the <b>podcast</b> and <b>discord</b>, are
          co-run by <a href="https://twitter.com/respdev">Leon</a> and
          <a href="https://twitter.com/vandesm14">Shane</a>. We're two friends
          who decided this would be fun, and it bloody well was!
        </p>

        <p>
          That's not also including the amazing help from people in the
          <b>discord</b> server keeping that in tip-top shape. Another massive
          thanks to you all!
        </p>

        <h2>Story Time</h2>

        <p>
          Before we started the <b>Responsive podcast</b> we started the
          <i><b>Responsive podcast</b></i>, the old one. We gave that a good
          shot but it didn't really stick. But a little while later we decided
          to give it another shot.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's when this <b>podcast</b> took off and we really began to enjoy
          ourselves. We get to engage with the community live during the
          <b>podcast</b> for questions, and just have a fun time talking
          <b>tech</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a short while we got a <b>discord</b> up and running for the
          <b>podcast community</b>. This would soon have a mix of members who
          had and hadn't listened to the <b>podcast</b> but also enjoyed
          <b>tech</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          And here we are today! Still kicking strong and with much more than
          just a <b>podcast</b> and <b>discord</b>, but also this site with
          its own <b>blog</b> and <b>showcases</b>!
        </p>

        <p>
          This is all thanks to the amazing community we have, so a massive
          thanks goes out to all of you!
