## Why?

This is not the main site, but more of a *what would I do*. You can find the
main site [here](https://respdev.com) if you haven't seen it yet.

What this is, is a recreation of the main site but with a few personal tweaks
and those sorts of things. As developers we all have our own preferences and
it's good to explore them. That said, remaking is not always necissary, but
good fun nonetheless.

## What's it made of?

This version of the main site is completely vanilla with the exception of
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). There's no real need to have
it, but it just made a few things easier to spot which is always nice.

Other than that there's nothing, just some good old vanilla JavaScript. As it
stands there's not much need for reactivity anyways, so it wasn't too big a
challenge. But who known, maybe we get to have some fun in that regard soon...

## Developing

I use VSCode with the **Live Server** extension and `tsc -w` when developing.
If needed, I'll setup a proper system, but this works great for now.
